## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This web application uses Javascript and Moment.js to dynamically update the scheduling and conditionally format the hours of the day. The styling of the webpage is formed via Bootstrap.


## Use
When accessing the planner you are able to view an hour by hour time block where you can schedule in notes for your day. Once the time has passed then the block will then be colored to indicate that the time is in the past. The same applies for the present hour block and future hour block.

You are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
once you click "save" you can store your notes to the specific timeblock you have chosen.

## Areas of improvement
The color coding is for the buttons only, not for the full bar. The colors could be more visible if the bar color changed instead of just the button.
